# FocoBot - Algorithm Learning Robot

FocoBot is a browser-based educational application designed to teach children the concept of algorithms. Users can create a simple movement algorithm by adding commands to a list, and FocoBot will execute these commands on a 15x15 cell grid.

## Overview

The application is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, intended to run in a browser or online version. FocoBot allows users to add movement commands (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`), `Rotate`, and `Color`, and the robot moves on the grid according to these commands. Each line in the user's created algorithm is numbered and highlighted during execution.

## Features

- **15x15 Grid:** The action area where the robot moves according to the entered commands.
- **Algorithm Commands:** Users can add commands like `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`, `Rotate`, and `Color`.
- **Algorithm Section:** Enables users to input and edit commands in a simple text editor with line numbers.
- **Active Line Highlighting:** The current line is highlighted as the robot executes the algorithm.
- **Control Buttons:** Includes `Start`, `Stop`, `Restart`, and `Reset` buttons to control algorithm execution.
- **Responsive Design:** The project is optimized for mobile devices, with scaled and adapted sections for smaller screens.

## Usage

- Adding Commands: Use the buttons in the algorithm section (Up, Down, Right, etc.) to add commands to the algorithm list.
- Executing the Algorithm: Press Start to begin algorithm execution. Each line will be highlighted as the robot executes the respective command.
- Control Execution: Use Stop to pause execution, Restart to rerun the algorithm without clearing commands, and Reset to fully clear commands and reset the robot.
